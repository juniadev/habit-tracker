# habit-tracker
Habit Tracker, an app made for Udacity's Android Basics nanodegree program.

The goal of this project was to design and create the structure of a Habit Tracking app which would allow a user to store and track their habits over time. This project didn't need any UI components; instead, we'd have to focus on what happens behind the scenes, practicing how to design and implement a simple database.
